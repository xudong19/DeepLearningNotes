steerability
debuggability
 - if model goes wrong, now what? where to collect fine tune data?
scalability/generalibitiy
 - more complex scenario, longer horizon

 Task-level planning
  - temporal-spatial keypoint relationship in order to finish a task


limited geometry understanding
limited visual understanding
keypoint representation is a compromise

foundation model missing part:
 - sensing (tactile sensing), simulatable tactile sensing
 - dynamics. how deformable object changes due to actions. Action - > state change
 - data
