General Comments:
------
* Well-designed attention models (complete for both spatial and temporal), especially that the temporal attention model is simple and good
* The spatial attention model seem over-engineered. The visualization result is not very satisfying either.
* Compared to other methods, no big improvements found. 

Main Innovations:
------
* Attention Models

Worth-noting:
------
* SIFT flow algorithm is to generate feature that are fed into the network
