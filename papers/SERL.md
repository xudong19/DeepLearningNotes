General Comments:
------
* Real-world RL library. Support all the vertical stacks: low-level controller,
RL algorithms, rewarding setting, without needing manual reset.
* 

Key ideas and technical details:
------
* relative coordinate system. proprioceptive info is expressed related to the inital pose,
action is expressed relative to the current EE frame (6D).
* 

Other noteworthy points:
------
* Low-level impedance controller to stablize things. RL policy run ~10hz. 
low-level controller run 1khz.
*
