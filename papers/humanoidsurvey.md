Other noteworthy points:
------
* RL and IL: 
 - teacher-student framework: RL model with access to priviledged info, and then teach a student model with IL.
 - IL pretrain and RL fine-tune
* imitate from human data
  - Three data sources: internet video, MoCap, aminations
  - approaches: GAIL, Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP), etc. Most of the studies are in simulation only.
* Inferring force sensing info from vision [399][400].
* collecting human kinetics data [403]
* h
