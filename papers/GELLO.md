[GELLO: A General, Low-Cost, and Intuitive Teleoperation Framework for Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13037) [RSJ24]
---------------	

__TL;DR__: A TeleOp system that control bimanual robot arms and simple grippers

__keywords__: TeleOp

__Resources__: [[Github](https://wuphilipp.github.io/gello_site/)] 

<!-- __Other Notable Info__: [blabla](blabla) -->

<br/>    

General Comments:
------
* Design a smaller size of bimanual robot to control the main robot. "scaled kinematically equivalent structure"
* better than 3D spacemouse and VR controller, the main advantage is its intuitiveness

* 


Key ideas and technical details:
------
* joint regularization to counteract the gravity
* 

Other noteworthy points:
------
* servo motors. joint encoder. physical resistance for stability
*
